# Overview

Introducing myself to the Django library in Python for backend web development.

Created a simple two page web app that includes a home page with a short history of the Gregorian Calendar, and a page with a funtional calendar built in js.

Having experience in node.js I wanted to expand my horizens, and see how project would be built in python. Django was my first choice due to available resources and accessibility.

# Web Pages

The project has 3 html files. One file called base.html, which provides a simple template for html on the other pages. This includes the simple header.

Both the home and calendar pages take this base template and then replace content on it dynamically in order to standardize things between them.
The home page contains a small history of the Gregorian Calendar, and the calendar page contains the functionaing calendar.

# Development Environment

Coded in Visual Studio code using Python 3, Django library for Python, html, css, and Javascript.

# Future Work

* Add database functionality (sql queries could populate the calendar with events.)
* Add authentication- don't want just anyone making queries.
